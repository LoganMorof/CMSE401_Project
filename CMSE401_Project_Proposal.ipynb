    "## Abstract  \n",
    "Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and prices often vary between different exchanges, creating opportunities for arbitrage. The goal of this project is to build a **Crypto Portfolio Price Tracker** that fetches real-time crypto prices from multiple exchanges using **parallel API requests**. By focusing on optimizing price-fetching performance, this project aims to provide a better understanding of how parallel computing can be applied in finance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **Python** as the primary programming language, along with **asyncio** and **aiohttp** for parallel API handling. The project will benchmark sequential versus parallel fetching of prices to optimize throughput and reduce response time.\n"

    "## Schedule  \n",
    "- **Week of February 5** – Project Proposal Submission  \n",
    "- **Week of February 12** – Research API endpoints for major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) and implement basic price-fetching logic  \n",
    "- **Week of February 19** – Integrate parallel API requests using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. Benchmark and compare sequential vs. parallel performance  \n",
    "- **Week of February 26** – Ensure the tool fetches data from at least three exchanges and build a basic console output to display prices  \n",
    "- **Week of March 4** – Add logic for detecting simple price discrepancies between exchanges  \n",
    "- **Week of March 11** – Build a simple real-time dashboard using Flask or Dash to display prices  \n",
    "- **Week of March 18** – Optimize dashboard performance and refresh rates  \n",
    "- **Week of April 1** – Perform final optimizations and test scalability  \n",
    "- **April 15** – Final Project Submission"

    "## Part 1: Software Exploration  \n",
    "For the first part of this project, I will explore how to interact with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges using their public APIs. The focus will be on **Binance**, **Coinbase**, and **Kraken** for real-time price data. I will use **Python** with `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for parallel API requests, which will significantly improve performance over sequential requests. I expect the outcome of this step to be a working codebase that can fetch prices from multiple exchanges and display them on the console in real time.  \n",

    "## Part 2: Benchmark and Optimization  \n",
    "The code for this project will initially fetch crypto prices sequentially and then be optimized to run in parallel using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. I will benchmark the response time for fetching data from multiple APIs and optimize throughput by reducing latency and increasing concurrency. The goal is to achieve at least a **3x speedup** compared to sequential fetching. Additionally, I will explore caching and optimizing the refresh rate in the real-time dashboard to improve performance.  \n",

    "**Expected Outcome:**  \n",
    "- Demonstrate a significant reduction in response time through parallel API requests  \n",
    "- Build a functional real-time dashboard for crypto price tracking\n"
